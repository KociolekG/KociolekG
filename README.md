### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Gage. Iâ€™m currently working on nothing yet because Iâ€™m beginning my coding journey learning C++ in Computer Science 1.
### I'm hoping this experience will improve my general skills in terms of communication and solo practice in the field for future reference.
### While I still am figuring out what I really want to do in this field, I believe Software Development is a start and I would like to learn to make simple games on the side.
### Coding languages that are in my interest as of now are C++, JS, and Python.
